# Equipment-Predictive-Maintenance-Fault-Diagnosis-System
Learning

📄 Overview

The Equipment Predictive Maintenance & Fault Diagnosis System is an AI-powered solution designed to monitor machinery, predict potential failures, and provide automated fault diagnosis.
The system utilizes Machine Learning models, sensor data, and data analytics to reduce downtime, improve operational efficiency, and optimize maintenance schedules.

#  Key Features

Real-time Sensor Data Monitoring
Collects parameters such as temperature, vibration, pressure, humidity, and equipment load.

Predictive Maintenance Using ML
ML models forecast upcoming failures before they occur, preventing breakdowns.

Fault Diagnosis & Classification
Identifies the exact type of fault (e.g., overheating, imbalance, misalignment, wear & tear).

Visual Dashboards
Interactive graphs for equipment health, prediction results, and alerts.

Alerting System
Notifies maintenance teams when equipment health reaches critical levels.

Scalable Architecture
Can be integrated into manufacturing plants, farms, cold storage units, and industrial IoT networks.
